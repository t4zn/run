# Jumpscare Reward Page

A single-page website that tricks users with a fake $1 reward claim, then delivers a jumpscare.

## Setup

1. Add your assets:
   - `scare.png` - A scary image (high contrast, sudden scary face)
   - `scream.mp3` - A short 1-2 second scream audio file

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Features

- Clean, trustworthy design that doesn't look suspicious
- Fake verification loader animation
- Fullscreen jumpscare overlay
- Audio scream (user-gesture triggered)
- Mobile vibration support
- Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space keys)
- Responsive design

## Assets Needed

- **scare.png**: High-contrast scary face image
- **scream.mp3**: Short scream audio file (1-2 seconds)

The page will work without these files but won't show the scare image or play audio.
